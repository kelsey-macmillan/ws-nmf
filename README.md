# Topic Supervised Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (TS-NMF)

This is the code for the model proposed in our NIPS 2017 paper submission:

	Topic Supervised NMF: An Interpretable Alternative to Unsupervised Topic Modeling,
  Kelsey MacMillan, James Wilson
	Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2017.
  
# TS-NMF Model Class

The code defining the proposed TS-NMF model class is found in `src/model/ws-nmf`. Models used for comparison are also found in this directory. The scikit-learn vectorizers used for our results are found in `src/features`. Please see code comments and `*_main.py` files for details and examples of usage.
